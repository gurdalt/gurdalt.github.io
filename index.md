## Introduction

This is an RStudio shiny application developed as a course project for Coursera's Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization track.
The application developed is a simple interest calculator.

# Course project requirements

The course project requirements for this application are:

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, â€¦)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

## Application - Widgets

The shiny application for this project is a simple interest calculator.
It includes 4 widgets:

 - numericInput - A field to enter numbers, in this case - the principal amount (in $)
 - sliderInput - A slider bar
   - First slider is to choose the yearly interest rate (in %)
   - Second slider is to choose the number of time periods
 - selectInput - A box with choices to select from, in this case - the type of time  - period: years, quarters or months
 - actionButton - An Action Button, in this case to provide non-reactive reactivity to refresh and calculate

## Application - Operations and Output

To prevent undue distraction, the reactivity of the shiny application widgets is controlled by using an actionButton. Based on user inputs, and using the simple interest calculation equation;

A = P + I = P(1 + rt) ; R = r * 100
where:
A = Total amount (Principal + Interest), P = Principal amount, I = Interest amount, r = Rate of interest per year, in decimal; r=R/100, t = Time period invested in years/quarters/months

An example calculation in R is given here for 2% interest per year for 5 years of $1000 as;

```r
P <- 1000
r <- 0.02
t <- 5
A <- P*(1+r*t)
A
```

```
## [1] 1100
```
